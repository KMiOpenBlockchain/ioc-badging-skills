  "description": "Proficiency in the architecture, design and development of reliable real time software, operating systems, tools and embedded systems. Embedding computer systems with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system, often with real-time, safety, security, and reliability constraints. Typically includes interfacing with hardware, mechanical sensors and actuators for monitoring and control in applications such as industrial, automotive, aerospace and medical machinery, robots and equipment including IoT (Internet of Things) devices.",

    "narrative": "The holder has applied relevant knowledge to demonstrate in a realistic (*) environment that they can perform most of the activities defined in the following SFIA description:  Develops real-time/embedded software architectures and designs to meet agreed systems specifications within resource constraints due to power, cost, physical space, response time and reliability. Selects programming languages, models, techniques, specialised tools and hardware to enable the design, development, debugging and validation of real-time/embedded software. Plans and manages real- time/embedded systems developments. Undertakes impact analysis on major design options and trade-offs between hardware and software, makes recommendations and assesses and manages associated risks. Validates and verifies other's designs to ensure selection of appropriate components and efficient use of resources. Investigates the impact of software requirements with complementary hardware and other related disciplines such as electrics, electronics, mechanics, acoustics, physiology and optics.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
