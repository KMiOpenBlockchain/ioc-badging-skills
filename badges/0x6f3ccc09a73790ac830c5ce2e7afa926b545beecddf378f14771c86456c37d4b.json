Translates concepts into outputs and prototypes and captures user feedback to improve designs. Specifies appropriate tools, methods and design patterns. Evaluates alternative design options and recommends designs taking into account performance, usability and accessibility requirements. Interprets and follows visual design and branding guidelines to create consistent and impactful user experience.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
