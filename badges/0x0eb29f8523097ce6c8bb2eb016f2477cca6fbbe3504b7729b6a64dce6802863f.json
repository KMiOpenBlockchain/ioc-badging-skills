    "narrative": "The holder has applied relevant knowledge to demonstrate in a realistic (*) environment that they can perform most of the activities defined in the following SFIA description:  Plans and performs all types of user experience evaluation to check and confirm that usability and accessibility requirements have been met. Selects appropriate use of formative or summative evaluations. Facilitates both moderated and unmoderated usability tests. Evaluates prototypes or designs of systems, products or services against the agreed usability and accessibility specifications. Interprets and presents results of evaluations and prioritises issues. Checks systems, products, or services which are in-use for changes in usability and accessibility needs and to ensure that these needs continue to be met. Assesses the stability of requirements against changes in context of use.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
