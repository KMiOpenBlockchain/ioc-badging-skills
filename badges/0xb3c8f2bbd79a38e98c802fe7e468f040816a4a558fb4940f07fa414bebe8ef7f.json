Resolves faults down to line replaceable unit (LRU) level or escalates according to given procedures. Carries out user confidence checks and escalates faults according to given procedures.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
