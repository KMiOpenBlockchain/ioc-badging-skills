Generates, produces and distributes reports. Uses measurement tools for routine analysis of data. Identifies and implements improvements to data collection methods.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
