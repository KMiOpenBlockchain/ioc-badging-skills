  "description": "Proficiency in the architecture, design and development of reliable real time software, operating systems, tools and embedded systems. Embedding computer systems with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system, often with real-time, safety, security, and reliability constraints. Typically includes interfacing with hardware, mechanical sensors and actuators for monitoring and control in applications such as industrial, automotive, aerospace and medical machinery, robots and equipment including IoT (Internet of Things) devices.",

    "narrative": "The holder has applied relevant knowledge to demonstrate in a realistic (*) environment that they can perform most of the activities defined in the following SFIA description:  Designs and develops complex real-time/embedded systems components often incorporating fail-safe characteristics or graceful degradation. Develops and implements software to operate in embedded systems. Develops prototypes or simulations of real time/embedded systems to support decision-making. Designs physical layouts reflecting connections between the components of real-time/embedded systems to test and optimise performance. Contributes to validation and verification activities. Uses specialised tools and hardware (such as logic analysers, in-circuit emulators or digital storage oscilloscopes) for developing, testing, debugging and troubleshooting of embedded software to ensure high levels of integrity and reliability.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
