  "description": "Proficiency in the architecture, design and development of reliable real time software, operating systems, tools and embedded systems. Embedding computer systems with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system, often with real-time, safety, security, and reliability constraints. Typically includes interfacing with hardware, mechanical sensors and actuators for monitoring and control in applications such as industrial, automotive, aerospace and medical machinery, robots and equipment including IoT (Internet of Things) devices.",

    "narrative": "The holder has applied relevant knowledge to demonstrate in a realistic (*) environment that they can perform most of the activities defined in the following SFIA description:  Designs the interactions between medium-complexity embedded systems components with hardware and the physical world through sensors, actuators and I/O ports. Selects and uses appropriate programming languages (high and low-level) and scripting languages to develop medium complex real-time/embedded components as part of an overall systems design typically requiring high levels of reliability or integrity. Applies a range of approaches to perform extensive testing of real-time/embedded systems, using specialised tools such as logic analysers, in-circuit emulators or digital storage oscilloscopes to demonstrate that high levels of systems integrity and reliability are addressed.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
