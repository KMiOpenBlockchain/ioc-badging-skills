Contributes to the design, configuration and testing of learning environments, including creation of simulated data, and replication of external systems, interfaces and assessment systems.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
