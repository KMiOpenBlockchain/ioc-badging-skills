Collaborates with technical teams to develop and agree system integration plans and report on progress. Defines complex/new integration builds. Ensures that integration test environments are correctly configured. Designs, performs and reports results of tests of the integration build. Identifies and documents system integration components for recording in the configuration management system. Recommends and implements improvements to processes and tools.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
