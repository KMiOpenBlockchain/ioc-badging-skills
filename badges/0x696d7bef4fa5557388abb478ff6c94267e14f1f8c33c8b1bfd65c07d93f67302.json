Makes informed decisions about the best way to present information to the audience(s), taking into consideration how information may be presented, identified, and searched for. Produces information artefacts that are accurate, current, relevant and easily understood by the intended audience(s). Applies moderation and editing processes to content supplied by others.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
