Selects, acquires and integrates data for analysis. Develops data hypotheses and methods, trains and evaluates analytics models, shares insights and findings and continues to iterate with additional data.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
