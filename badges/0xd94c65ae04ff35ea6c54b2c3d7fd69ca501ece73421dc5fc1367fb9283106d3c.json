Influences industry-based models for the development of new technology components. Develops effective procurement strategies, consistent with business needs. Ensures adherence to that relevant technical strategies, policies, standards and practices.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
