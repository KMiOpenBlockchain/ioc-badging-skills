Assesses proposed changes to object/data structures, in order to evaluate alternative options. Implements physical database designs to support transactional data requirements for performance and availability. Implements data warehouse designs that support demands for business intelligence and data analytics.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
