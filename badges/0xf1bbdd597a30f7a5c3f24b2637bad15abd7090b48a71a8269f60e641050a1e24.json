Uses iterative approaches to rapidly incorporate user feedback into designs. Plans and drives user experience design activities providing expert advice and guidance to support adoption of agreed approaches. Integrates required visual design and branding into the user experience design activities.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
