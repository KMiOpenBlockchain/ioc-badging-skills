Produces and analyses registers and histories of authorised assets (including secure master copies of software, documentation, data, licenses and agreements for supply, warranty and maintenance), and verifies that all these assets are in a known state and location. Acts to highlight and resolve potential instances of unauthorised assets such as unlicensed copies of software.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
