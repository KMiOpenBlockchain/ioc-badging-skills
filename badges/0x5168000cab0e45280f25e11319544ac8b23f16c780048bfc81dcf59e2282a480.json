    "narrative": "The holder has applied relevant knowledge to demonstrate in a realistic (*) environment that they can perform most of the activities defined in the following SFIA description:  Supports projects, functions or teams in the development of project and/or operational methods for measurement. Specifies base and derived measures which support agreed information needs. Identifies and prioritises appropriate measures, scales, and targets. Specifies how to collect and store the data for each required measure. Provides guidance on collection of data including automation. Designs reports and reporting formats.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
