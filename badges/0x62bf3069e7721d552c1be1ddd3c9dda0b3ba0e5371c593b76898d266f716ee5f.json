Plans and leads organisation design activities; identifies alternatives, assesses feasibility, and recommends solutions. Identifies major changes affecting the organisation, and mobilises resources to implement changes. Initiates the definition of new organisation boundaries, and creates future organisation design, including location strategy and the number of locations required. Outlines performance measurement objectives and the high-level implementation approach.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
