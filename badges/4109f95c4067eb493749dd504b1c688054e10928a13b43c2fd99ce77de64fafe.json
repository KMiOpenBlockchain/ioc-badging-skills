    "narrative": "The holder has demonstrated that they can explain and discuss the knowledge relevant to the following SFIA description: Designs and develops complex real-time/embedded systems components often incorporating fail-safe characteristics or graceful degradation. Develops and implements software to operate in embedded systems. Develops prototypes or simulations of real time/embedded systems to support decision-making. Designs physical layouts reflecting connections between the components of real-time/embedded systems to test and optimise performance. Contributes to validation and verification activities. Uses specialised tools and hardware (such as logic analysers, in-circuit emulators or digital storage oscilloscopes) for developing, testing, debugging and troubleshooting of embedded software to ensure high levels of integrity and reliability."
