Delivers objective insights into the existence of vulnerabilities, the effectiveness of defences and mitigating controls - both those already in place and those planned for future implementation. Takes responsibility for integrity of testing activities and coordinates the execution of these activities. Provides authoritative advice and guidance on the planning and execution of vulnerability tests. Defines and communicates the test strategy. Manages all test processes, and contributes to corporate security testing standards.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
