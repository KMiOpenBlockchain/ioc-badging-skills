The negotiation of trade-offs that are both acceptable to key stakeholders and within budgetary, technical, regulatory, and other constraints. The adoption and adaptation of requirements management lifecycle models based on the context of the work and selecting appropriately from plan-driven/predictive approaches or more adaptive (iterative and agile) approaches.",

Uses standard techniques to elicit, specify, and document requirements for simple subject areas with clearly-defined boundaries. Assists in the creation of a requirements baseline and in investigating and applying authorised requests for changes to base-lined requirements, in line with change management policy.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
