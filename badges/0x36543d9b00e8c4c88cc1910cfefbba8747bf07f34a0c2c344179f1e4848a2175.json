Operationalises and automates activities for efficient and timely production of data visuals. Selects appropriate visualisation approach from a range of applicable options. Contributes to exploration and experimentation in data visualisation.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
