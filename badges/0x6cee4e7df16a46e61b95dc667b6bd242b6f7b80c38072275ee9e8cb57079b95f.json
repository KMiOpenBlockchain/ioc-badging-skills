    "narrative": "The holder has applied relevant knowledge to demonstrate in a realistic (*) environment that they can perform most of the activities defined in the following SFIA description:  Conducts advanced modelling activities for significant change programmes and across multiple business functions. Has an in-depth knowledge of organisation-standard techniques. Plans own modelling activities, selecting appropriate techniques and the correct level of detail for meeting assigned objectives. May contribute to discussions about the choice of the modelling approach to be used. Obtains input from and communicates modelling results to senior managers for agreement.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
