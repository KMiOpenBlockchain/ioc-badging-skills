  "description": "Proficiency in the planning, design and management of the capability, functionality and sustainability of service components (including hardware, software, network resources and software/infrastructure as a Service) to meet current and forecast needs in a cost-efficient manner aligned to the business. The modelling of both long-term changes and short-term variations in the level of capacity required to execute the service. The deployment of techniques to control the demand and add/reduce capacity in a cost effective, timely manner to meet changes in demand.",

    "narrative": "The holder has applied relevant knowledge to demonstrate in a realistic (*) environment that they can perform most of the activities defined in the following SFIA description:  Monitors service component capacity and initiates actions to resolve any shortfalls according to agreed procedures. Applies techniques to control the demand upon a particular resource or service. Contributes to capacity modelling and planning. Supports the design of service component capacity.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
