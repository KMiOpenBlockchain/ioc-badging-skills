  "description": "Knowledge of the design of systems to meet specified requirements, compatible with agreed systems architectures, adhering to corporate standards and within constraints of performance and feasibility. The identification of concepts and their translation into a design which forms the basis for systems construction and verification. The design or selection of components. The development of a complete set of detailed models, properties, and/or characteristics described in a form suitable for implementation. The adoption and adaptation of systems design lifecycle models based on the context of the work and selecting appropriately from predictive (plan-driven) approaches or adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches.",

    "narrative": "The holder has demonstrated that they can explain and discuss the knowledge relevant to the following SFIA description: Designs components using appropriate modelling techniques following agreed architectures, design standards, patterns and methodology. Identifies and evaluates alternative design options and trade-offs. Creates multiple design views to address the concerns of the different stakeholders of the architecture and to handle both functional and non-functional requirements. Models, simulates or prototypes the behaviour of proposed systems components to enable approval by stakeholders. Produces detailed design specification to form the basis for construction of systems. Reviews, verifies and improves own designs against specifications."
