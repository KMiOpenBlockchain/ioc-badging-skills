    "narrative": "The holder has applied relevant knowledge to demonstrate in a realistic (*) environment that they can perform most of the activities defined in the following SFIA description:  Takes a comprehensive approach to seeking vulnerabilities across the full spectrum of organisation policies, processes, and defences in order to improve organisational readiness, improve training for defensive practitioners, and inspect current performance levels. Determines testing policy, and owns the supporting processes. Takes responsibility for the management of all vulnerability testing activities within the organisation. Assesses and advises on the practicality of testing process alternatives. Initiates improvements to test processes and directs their implementation. Assesses suppliers' development and testing capabilities. Manages client relationships with respect to all testing matters.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
