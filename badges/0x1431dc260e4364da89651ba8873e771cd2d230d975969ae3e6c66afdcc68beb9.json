Creates workable prototypes. Assists, as part of a team, on overall user experience design. Assists in the evaluation of design options and trade-offs. Consistently applies visual design and branding guidelines.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
