Taking an approach that incorporates significant involvement of users in research to generate deep understanding and uncover new opportunities for systems, products and services. The quantification of different user populations and their needs, identifying target users and segments in order to maximise the chances of design success for systems, products and services. The inclusion of a range of users in research activities to capture the diversity of users of the organisation's systems, products and services and the imperative to make these usable and accessible for everyone.",

Involves wider team in research activities. Engages effectively with users and customer representatives to generate high quality research. Documents and shares the outcomes of user research.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
