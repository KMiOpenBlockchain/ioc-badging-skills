  "description": "Competence in the architecture, design and development of reliable real time software, operating systems, tools and embedded systems. Embedding computer systems with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system, often with real-time, safety, security, and reliability constraints. Typically includes interfacing with hardware, mechanical sensors and actuators for monitoring and control in applications such as industrial, automotive, aerospace and medical machinery, robots and equipment including IoT (Internet of Things) devices.",

    "narrative": "The holder has demonstrated, in a working environment, that they have consistently and reliably achieved the expected outcomes at a professional level for the following SFIA description: Designs the interactions between simple embedded systems components with hardware and the physical world, through sensors, actuators and I/O ports. Uses low level programming languages to develop simple real-time/embedded components as part of an overall systems design. Applies standard approaches to perform extensive testing of real-time/embedded systems, using specialised tools such as logic analysers, in-circuit emulators or digital storage oscilloscopes."
