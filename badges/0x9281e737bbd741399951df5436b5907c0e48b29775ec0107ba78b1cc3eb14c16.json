Specifies and applies appropriate mathematical, statistical, predictive modelling or machine-learning techniques to analyse data, generate insights, create value and support decision-making. Manages reviews of the benefits and value of analytics techniques and tools and recommends improvements. Contributes to the development of analytics policy, standards and guidelines.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
