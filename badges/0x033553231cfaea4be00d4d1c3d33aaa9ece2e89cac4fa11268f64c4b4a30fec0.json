Ensures that projects, teams and functions have appropriate practices in place and are meeting required organisational quality levels. Determines areas where existing processes should change from analysing audit findings. Takes responsibility for controlling updating and distributing organisational standards. Facilitates improvements to processes by changing approaches and working practices, typically using recognised models.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
