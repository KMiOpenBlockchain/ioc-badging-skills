  "description": "Competence in the specification and design of software to meet defined requirements by following agreed design standards and principles. The definition of software, components, interfaces and related characteristics. The identification of concepts and patterns and the translation into a design which provides a basis for software construction and verification. The evaluation of alternative solutions and trade-offs. The facilitation of design decisions within the constraints of systems designs, design standards, quality, feasibility, extensibility and maintainability. The development and iteration of prototypes/simulations to enable informed decision-making. The adoption and adaptation of software design models, tools and techniques based on the context of the work and selecting appropriately from predictive (plan-driven) approaches or adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches.",

Assists as part of a team in the design of components of larger software systems. Specifies user and/or system interfaces. Creates multiple design views to address the concerns of the different stakeholders of the design and to handle separately functional and non-functional requirements. Assists in the evaluation of options and trade-offs. Collaborates in reviews of work with others as appropriate."
