Develops real-time/embedded software architectures in order to exploit new technologies or new uses for existing technologies. Develops effective implementation and procurement strategies, consistent with specified requirements, systems architectures and constraints of performance, cost and feasibility. Sets organisational policies and standards for, and leads on, the development of real-time/embedded systems including how critical non-functional requirements such as performance, safety, security, and reliability are achieved. Drives adoption of and adherence to relevant strategies, policies, standards."
