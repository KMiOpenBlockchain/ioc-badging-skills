    "narrative": "The holder has applied relevant knowledge to demonstrate in a realistic (*) environment that they can perform most of the activities defined in the following SFIA description:  Uses design tools (such as wireframes) to evolve prototypes of web pages. Using complex visual design tools, employs organic modelling techniques, such as boned rigs to create and animate virtual characters within the context of a game (or similar system) design. Builds visual and audio components.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
