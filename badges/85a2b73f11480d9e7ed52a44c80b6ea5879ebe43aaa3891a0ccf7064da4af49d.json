    "narrative": "The holder has demonstrated that they can explain and discuss the knowledge relevant to the following SFIA description: Develops real-time/embedded software architectures and designs to meet agreed systems specifications within resource constraints due to power, cost, physical space, response time and reliability. Selects programming languages, models, techniques, specialised tools and hardware to enable the design, development, debugging and validation of real-time/embedded software. Plans and manages real- time/embedded systems developments. Undertakes impact analysis on major design options and trade-offs between hardware and software, makes recommendations and assesses and manages associated risks. Validates and verifies other's designs to ensure selection of appropriate components and efficient use of resources. Investigates the impact of software requirements with complementary hardware and other related disciplines such as electrics, electronics, mechanics, acoustics, physiology and optics."
