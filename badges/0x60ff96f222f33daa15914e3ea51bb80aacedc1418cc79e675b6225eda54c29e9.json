Ensures that operational processes are in place to maintain secure configuration, consistent classification and management of CIs, and for the verification and audit of configuration records. Develops, configures and maintains tools (including automation) to identify, track, log and maintain accurate, complete and current information. Reports on the status of configuration management. Identifies problems and issues and recommend corrective actions.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
