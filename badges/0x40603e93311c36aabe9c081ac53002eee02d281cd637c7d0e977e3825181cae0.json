Develops organisational policies, standards, and guidelines for skills/competency assessments aligned with ethical, legal and regulatory requirements. Leads in the introduction and use of assessment methodologies and tools. Determines the need for internal and/or external consistency and reliability of assessment outcomes and how this can be achieved across different user groups.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
