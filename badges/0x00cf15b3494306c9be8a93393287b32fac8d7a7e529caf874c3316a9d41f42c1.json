  "description": "Proficiency in the specification and design of software to meet defined requirements by following agreed design standards and principles. The definition of software, components, interfaces and related characteristics. The identification of concepts and patterns and the translation into a design which provides a basis for software construction and verification. The evaluation of alternative solutions and trade-offs. The facilitation of design decisions within the constraints of systems designs, design standards, quality, feasibility, extensibility and maintainability. The development and iteration of prototypes/simulations to enable informed decision-making. The adoption and adaptation of software design models, tools and techniques based on the context of the work and selecting appropriately from predictive (plan-driven) approaches or adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches.",

    "narrative": "The holder has applied relevant knowledge to demonstrate in a realistic (*) environment that they can perform most of the activities defined in the following SFIA description:  Leads the selection and development of appropriate software design methods, tools, techniques; whether predictive (plan-driven) approaches or more adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches. Develops organisational policies, standards, and guidelines for software design and software architectures. Ensures adherence to technical strategies and systems architectures (including security).\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
