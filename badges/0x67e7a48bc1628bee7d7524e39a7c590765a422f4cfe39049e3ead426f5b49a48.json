Searches for relevant material using specialised websites and sources, reads relevant articles to update knowledge of the relevant field. Reports on work carried out and may contribute sections of material of publication quality. Curates, under guidance, a personal collection of relevant material.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
