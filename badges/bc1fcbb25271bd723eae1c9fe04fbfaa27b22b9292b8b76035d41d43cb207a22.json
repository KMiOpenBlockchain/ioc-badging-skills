Specifies and designs large or complex software components. Undertakes impact analysis on major design options, makes recommendations and assesses and manages associated risks. Specifies prototypes/simulations to enable informed decision making. Evaluates the quality of others' systems designs to ensure adherence to standards and identifies corrective action, if needed. Ensures that the system design balances functional, quality, security and systems management requirements. Contributes to development of organisational software design and architecture policies and standards."
