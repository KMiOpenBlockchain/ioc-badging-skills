Tests the usability and accessibility of components and alternative designs. Administers a range of evaluations, recording data and feedback. Analyses evaluation data and recommend actions. Checks systems, products or services for adherence to applicable standards, guidelines, style guides, and legislation. Evaluates the usability of existing or competitor systems to provide benchmark values and as input to design.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
