  "description": "Proficiency in the architecture, design and development of reliable real time software, operating systems, tools and embedded systems. Embedding computer systems with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system, often with real-time, safety, security, and reliability constraints. Typically includes interfacing with hardware, mechanical sensors and actuators for monitoring and control in applications such as industrial, automotive, aerospace and medical machinery, robots and equipment including IoT (Internet of Things) devices.",

    "narrative": "The holder has applied relevant knowledge to demonstrate in a realistic (*) environment that they can perform most of the activities defined in the following SFIA description:  Provides overall direction in the conception and design of real-time/embedded systems. Develops real-time/embedded software architectures in order to exploit new technologies or new uses for existing technologies. Develops effective implementation and procurement strategies, consistent with specified requirements, systems architectures and constraints of performance, cost and feasibility. Sets organisational policies and standards for, and leads on, the development of real-time/embedded systems including how critical non-functional requirements such as performance, safety, security, and reliability are achieved. Drives adoption of and adherence to relevant strategies, policies, standards.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
