  "description": "Knowledge of the specification and design of software to meet defined requirements by following agreed design standards and principles. The definition of software, components, interfaces and related characteristics. The identification of concepts and patterns and the translation into a design which provides a basis for software construction and verification. The evaluation of alternative solutions and trade-offs. The facilitation of design decisions within the constraints of systems designs, design standards, quality, feasibility, extensibility and maintainability. The development and iteration of prototypes/simulations to enable informed decision-making. The adoption and adaptation of software design models, tools and techniques based on the context of the work and selecting appropriately from predictive (plan-driven) approaches or adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches.",

    "narrative": "The holder has demonstrated that they can explain and discuss the knowledge relevant to the following SFIA description: Designs software components and modules using appropriate modelling techniques following agreed software design standards, patterns and methodology. Creates and communicates multiple design views to identify and balance the concerns of all stakeholders of the software design and to allow for both functional and non-functional requirements. Identifies and evaluates alternative design options and trade-offs. Recommends designs which take into account target environment, performance security requirements and existing systems. Reviews, verifies and improves own designs against specifications. Leads reviews of others' designs. Models, simulates or prototypes the behaviour of proposed software to enable approval by stakeholders, and effective construction of the software. Verifies software design by constructing and applying appropriate methods."
