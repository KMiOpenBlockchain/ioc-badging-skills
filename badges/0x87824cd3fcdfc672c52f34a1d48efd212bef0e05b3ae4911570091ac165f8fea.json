Examines records for evidence that appropriate testing and other quality control activities have taken place and determines compliance with organisational directives, standards and procedures. Identifies non-compliances, non-conformances and abnormal occurrences.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
