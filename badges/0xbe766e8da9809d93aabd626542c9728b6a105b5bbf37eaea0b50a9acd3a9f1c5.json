Accepts completed software modules, ensuring that they meet defined criteria. Produces software builds from software source code for loading onto target hardware. Configures the hardware and software environment as required by the system being integrated. Produces integration test specifications, conducts tests and records and reports on outcomes. Diagnoses faults and records and reports on the results of tests. Produces system integration reports.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
