Authorises the structure of systems development functions and platforms and is responsible for alignment with business strategy & objectives and with emerging IT and digital opportunities. Sets strategy for resource management within systems development, authorises the allocation of resources for systems development programmes, and maintains an overview of the contribution of such programmes to organisational success. Manages the quality and appropriateness of the work performed and delivers measurable business benefits.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
