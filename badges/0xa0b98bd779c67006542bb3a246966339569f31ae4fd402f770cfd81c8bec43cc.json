Commissions the development of learning materials, allocates resources to learning teams, defines learning outcomes. Leads learning programs, recommends and specifies learning interventions for design, development and deployment according to agreed learning outcomes.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
