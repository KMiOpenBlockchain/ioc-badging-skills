Plans and drives software construction activities. Adopts and adapts appropriate software development methods, tools and techniques selecting appropriately from predictive (plan-driven) approaches or adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches. Measures and monitors applications of project/team standards for software construction including software security. Contributes to the development of organisational policies, standards, and guidelines for software development.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
