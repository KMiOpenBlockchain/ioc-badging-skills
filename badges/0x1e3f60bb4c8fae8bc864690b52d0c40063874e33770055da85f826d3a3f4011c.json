The quantification of different user populations and their needs, identifying target users and segments in order to maximise the chances of design success for systems, products and services. The inclusion of a range of users in research activities to capture the diversity of users of the organisation's systems, products and services and the imperative to make these usable and accessible for everyone.",

Leads the collection and analysis of data related to people's behaviours, needs, and opinions. Synthesises findings, develops insights and presents findings to inform decision making and drive actions. Plans and drives the user research activities providing expert advice and guidance to support adoption of agreed approaches. Contributes to the development of organisational methods and standards for user research.\n\n* Whilst proficiency must be demonstrated in a working context, a workplace supervisor may make a case to justify the use of a professional simulated environment for specific safety-critical tasks."
